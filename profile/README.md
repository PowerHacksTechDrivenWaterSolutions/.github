# Power Hacks 2nd Edition 2023

## Tech for Driven water solution Hackathon.

Objective: 
- The objective of the Hackathon is to create innovative  technology solution that can address pressing social issues and improve the lives of people.

Date and Venue: 
- The Hackathon will be held on March 14-23, 2023. The venue will be online.

Participants: 
- The Hackathon is open to all Power learn Project students regardless of the cohort and outside competitors.

This question provides a specific focus on the challenge of water scarcity, which affects many communities around the world. Participants can approach this question from different angles, such as developing a low-cost water purification system that can be easily deployed in rural areas, creating a mobile app that maps water sources and tracks water quality in real-time, or designing a sensor network that monitors water usage and identifies leaks in urban water infrastructure. The question also encourages participants to consider the social and environmental dimensions of the problem, such as the impact of water scarcity on public health, education, and economic development, as well as the role of sustainable water management practices in mitigating the effects of climate change.

# Themes : Be The Change

1. Water Solution : Participant can develop solution to locate the nearest clean water source.
2. Water solution: Participant can create solution that can locate the nearest water treatment facility.

Agenda:

**Day 1:**
Hackathon kick-off and start of coding .
You are expected to submit your Figma design of your projects by the end of the day.

**Day 2-5:**
Coding of the project.
Pitching and feedback sessions.

**Day 6:**
Finalize projects and presentations.
Sending the Project to the Power Learn Project GitHub Organization.


## Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

**Problem 1 - predicting water quality. **

The dataset contains information on various physical and chemical parameters of water samples collected from different sources, such as lakes, rivers, and groundwater. The parameters include pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, and other variables that can affect water potability. 

Participants in the hackathon can use this dataset to develop machine learning models that predict the water quality parameters and determine whether the water is potable or not. They could also explore different algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy of their models.

The goal of the hackathon problem would be to develop a predictive model that could be used by water resource management agencies to monitor and address water quality issues in African rivers. The participants could also explore ways to visualize and present the data in a meaningful way to stakeholders and decision-makers.

**Problem 2: Predicting Water Scarcity Levels in African Countries Dataset: **

The dataset contains information on water scarcity levels in various African countries, measured by the Water Scarcity Index (WSI). The WSI is calculated based on factors such as water availability, water quality, and water demand. Other variables in the dataset include population, urbanization rate, and economic indicators. 

Participants in the hackathon could use this dataset to develop machine learning models that predict water scarcity levels in different African countries. The models could be trained on historical data and tested on more recent data to assess their accuracy. Participants could also explore different variables and features that may affect water scarcity levels and develop models that take these factors into account.

The goal of the hackathon problem would be to develop a predictive model that could be used by water resource management agencies to plan and allocate resources for regions facing water scarcity. The participants could also explore ways to improve the accuracy and reliability of the models, such as incorporating additional data sources or using ensemble techniques.
